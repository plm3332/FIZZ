1,Polytope,cnndm,b364-10,"tokyo ( cnn ) a bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones .
a drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of japan 's equivalent to the white house on wednesday , police and government officials said .
the discovery came on the same day a japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture , more than four years after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster .
prime minister shinzo abe 's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many japanese , who view nuclear energy as too dangerous .
a staff member spotted the drone wednesday morning on the roof of abe 's residence , tokyo metropolitan police said .
dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone , which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters ( 20 inches ) wide .
police say the drone was equipped with a small camera , smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium , a common byproduct of nuclear reactors .
cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed fukushima daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown .
investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle .
the amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans .
chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism .
"" there might be terrorism attempts in the future at the olympics and g7 summit using drones , "" suga said .
"" so we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones .
the government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism . ""
japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft , but there are no flight restrictions for most of tokyo , including the prime minister 's residence and local and federal government buildings .

2,Polytope,cnndm,b353-10,"more than 25 women have been airlifted from royal navy ships because of pregnancy .
one ship - hms ocean -- even had five pregnant sailors removed in emergency ` medevacs ' during the last nine years , a freedom of information request revealed .
and at least one woman was airlifted from hms illustrious , which was nicknamed ` hms lusty ' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year .
more than 25 women have been airlifted from royal navy ships because of pregnancy , including at least one woman from hms illustrious ( above ) , which was nicknamed ` hms lusty ' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year
eighteen other ships - including hms dragon , hms enterprise and hms richmond - had emergency evacuations , data obtained by the sun showed .
a ministry of defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict ` no touching ' rule in place at sea , which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave .
the data comes nine months after commander sarah west , the first woman to captain a royal navy warship , was flown back to the uk following claims she had a sexual relationship with a member of her crew .
an unnamed captain was appointed in her place and a military investigation was launched into the 42-year-old 's conduct .
a ministry of defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict ` no touching ' rule in place at sea , which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave ( stock image above )
navy sources said ms west left hms portland for ` personal reasons ' .
the ministry of defence would not confirm what these reasons were or what action she would face .
women have been serving on royal navy ships since 1990 and in 2014 around 9 per cent of personnel were female .
last may three women made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the royal navy .
nearly 100 female british soldiers were sent home from afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant .
ninety-nine servicewomen on operations were flown back to the uk between january 2006 and december 2013 , a freedom of information request revealed .
sixteen women were removed from afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy while 18 were sent home in 2011 , the data showed .
a further 102 women were evacuated from iraq .
strict military rules ban mothers-to-be from serving in war zones .
the women were flown back on flights usually reserved for injured troops and the true figure could be higher if others travelled via routine flights .
troops are reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front line - but are not made to do pregnancy tests .
most of the babies would have been conceived before the mother left the uk but a small number of women may have become pregnant on tour .
a ministry of defence spokesman said at the time : ` the small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations are returned at the first convenient opportunity . '","more than 25 women have been airlifted from royal navy ships because of pregnancy .

breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ` markers ' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness .
after surgery , the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened , and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning .
for some women , the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent , which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy .
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence .
although the medication kills off cancer cells , the side effects -- including complete hair loss , nausea , sickness , weight gain or loss , and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with .
for some women , the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself .
but experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others , and that for some , chemotherapy may not be necessary .
if the newest of the tests , called endopredict , shows a low score , patients can opt not to have chemotherapy .
most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £ 2,500 , although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the nhs .
surgeon hemant singhal said : ` i think there is a good case for the nhs to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy . '
professor kefah mokbel , consultant breast surgeon at st george 's hospital , london , said : ` with this test we can help patients make an informed choice , whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone . '
becca cornford , a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11 , six and four , was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast .

she said : ` i dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy .
i was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children . '
professor mokbel operated on becca in december at the princess grace hospital , london , and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the endopredict .
a low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds .
